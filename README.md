## What is Flexiboard?

Flexiboard is an entirely flexible note-taking application that allows the user to have several notes of different sizes arranged on a virtual desktop. Users can move and resize their notecards, as well as creating new notes.

## What's next?

I am currently developing features that will allow the user to establish a socket connection with another user enabling direct collaboration on the same board. Users will also be able to save boards and access old boards.

## Running locally

If you clone this project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
